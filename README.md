# Clean TimThumb

This script allows to load images using [TimThumb] using cleaner URLs, Using this script instead of passing the `src` param in the url, you call the image you want using it's name and extension, e.g.

~~~~
Normal TimThumb
http://example.com/images/timthumb.php?scr="logo.jgp&w=150"

With Clean TimThumb
http://example.com/images/logo.jpg?w=150
